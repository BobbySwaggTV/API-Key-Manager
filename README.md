# 15th MEU API Key Manager

A XenForo 2.3+ add-on that allows users to generate and manage personal API keys for external API integrations.

15th MEU fork of the upstream [7Cav API Key Manager](https://github.com/7Cav/API-Key-Manager) project.

## Features

- Per-user API key generation with secure hashed storage
- Key prefix display for easy identification
- Rotate or permanently revoke keys at any time
- Usage tracking via `last_used_date`
- Usergroup-gated scopes — each scope is tied to one or more XenForo usergroups and granted to a user's key automatically based on their group memberships (primary + secondary)
- Auto-revocation — when a user's group membership changes, their key's scopes are recomputed; no manual reissue needed
- Admin panel for viewing and revoking all keys

## Requirements

- XenForo 2.3.0 or later
- PHP 8.0+

## Installation

1. Upload the contents of the `upload/` directory to your XenForo root.
2. In the Admin Control Panel, go to **Add-ons** and install `Cav7/ApiKeyManager`.
3. The installer will create the required `xf_15meu_api_key` database table automatically.

## Usage

### Users
Users can generate and manage their API key from their **Account** page. Only one key is allowed per user. Keys can be rotated or revoked at any time.

### Admins
Admins can view and revoke any user's API key via the ACP at **Admin > API Keys**.

### Scope management
Admins define the available scopes in the ACP at **Admin > API Scopes**. Each scope has a name (the wire identifier used by the API consumer), a human title, and an optional list of gating usergroups. Scopes with no groups attached are granted to every user with a key; scopes with groups are granted only to users in at least one of those groups (primary or secondary). Scope grants are recomputed automatically when a user's group membership changes or when a scope definition is edited.

### API Authentication
Include the API key in requests to authenticate. The consumer API validates the key against the database and checks that the key holds the scope required by the requested endpoint. See the upstream [7Cav API](https://github.com/7Cav/api) for the validation query and scope-check design this add-on implements.

This add-on is specifically designed to work with the 15th MEU API.
